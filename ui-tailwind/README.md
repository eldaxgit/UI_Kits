# Responsive Cards with Tailwind CSS

This is a simple, responsive webpage that features a navigation bar, a set of responsive cards, and a modal. The project is built using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. The layout adjusts seamlessly for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The cards and modal automatically adjust to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Mobile Menu:** The navigation menu includes an off-canvas mobile menu that is triggered by a hamburger button on smaller screens.
- **Modal:** The modal can be opened and closed using buttons. It adjusts in size based on the screen size.
- **Tailwind CSS:** The entire layout is styled using Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN)
- **JavaScript**
- **SVG Icons** for the mobile menu

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   To start using the code locally, clone the repository (or copy the HTML into your project).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/responsive-cards.git

   ```

2. Open the HTML File:
   Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to see the layout in action.

## Features Breakdown

1. Navbar
   The navigation bar contains links for Home, About, and Contact. On small screens (mobile), a hamburger menu icon appears, which toggles an off-canvas mobile menu.

2. Cards Section
   The page features three responsive cards with hover effects. On mobile, the cards are displayed in a single column, on tablet screens in two columns, and on desktop screens in three columns.

3. Modal
   The modal can be opened by clicking the "Open Modal" button. Once opened, it displays a message and a "Close" button that hides the modal. It is styled to be responsive, with its width adjusting based on screen size.

4. Mobile Menu Functionality
   The mobile menu opens when the hamburger button is clicked and closes when the "X" button is clicked.

5. Tailwind CSS Classes
   The layout and design are styled using Tailwind CSS classes like bg-slate-900, p-4, grid, shadow-lg, etc., making it highly customizable.
